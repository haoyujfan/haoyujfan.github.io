	<h1>HELLO, MY NAME IS JOSHUA AND I'M AN AUSTIN BASED SOFTWARE ENGINEER.</h1>
	<div class="text1">
		<p>I’ve always loved computers. I’ve always loved their intricacies.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text2">
		<p>Growing up, I clearly remember the rare days we spent in the computer lab since they were my only chances to fiddle with such an incredible machine. Everything about it from the images being displayed to the immediate responses I got from moving the plastic mouse pulled me in further and further.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text3">
		<p>That’s why I never had any trouble with the “What do you want to do when you grow up?” questions (except for becoming the next NBA superstar but my stunted growth dispelled that dream).</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text4">
		<p>With this love for computers, I began taking time to learn as much as I could about them. I learned about hardware, but more importantly, I was introduced to the hidden internal foundation that made everything possible: software.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text5">
		<p>Fast-forwarding many years of side explorations into the world of software and algorithms, I was admitted into the Computer Science program at the University of Texas at Austin. Here, I finally had the chance to pour my undivided attention and studies into learning more about this foundation for every single piece of technology. Wanting to challenge myself and expand my scope, I also began pursuing a certificate in Applied Statistical Modeling.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text6">
		<p>I have many aspirations for my future in software engineering and hope to bring my passions and abilities to various companies. If you are looking for someone who may not know everything but is willing and excited to put in the time and effort to collaboratively reach company goals, you have come to the perfect place. My CV, GitHub, and LinkedIn are all included at the top of the page, but feel free to reach out anytime using my phone number (832-835-4103) or by email (haoyujfan@gmail.com). I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
